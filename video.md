## My Experience to Produce Short Videos
I worked in Haifeng Media to produce short videos. This blog introduces the aims, target groups, experience of, and the designs, skills used in, the video-making process. To watch these videos, please visit [here](./).
### Product Positioning
The brand name of our videos is Story-Spaceship, and the slogan is to let stories and books accompany children's growth. The goal of video is to expand brand influence and promote the transformation of existing magazines into new media field. At the same time, we recommend picture books to children from the perspective of professional editors to help children solve problems in their growth and let young parents accompany their children.

According to our company background and the existing works, the video focuses on children's education, including recommending picture books, shaping children's character, forming children's behavior habits, providing parents with education methods, etc.

The targeted users are young parents and people engaged in children's education. For example:
* Urban white-collar workers with high salaries but busy work have no time to tell stories or choose books for their children. These people have purchasing power but no time. Picture books or educational methods we recommend can meet their needs.
* New parents have no idea to solve the problems their children encounter in growth, such as how to mitigate their children's bad emotions. We introduce some techniques aiming at solving one specific problem in each video, which can provide useful and practical advice for beginner parents.
* Preschool teachers can enrich their visions and teaching methods. We recommend the method of learning numbers in a video, which can be applied to their ordinary teaching.

An effective way to establish reasonable goals is to follow competitive videos and analyze their video statistics. Through comparisons, we set up two goals. The first is to increase the views and likes of our videos. The long-term goal is at least 10,000 likes for each video, but we allow the existence of low attention in the early stage. The second is strong profitability. With the development of video, it is expected to make money by selling picture books.
### Considerations for Scriptwriting
I choose the topic and the introduced picture book of the video based on several principles. 

The selection of the topic is based on:
*  recent festivals and hot topics, e.g., on the Winter Solstice in China, we published a video to introduce a popular science book about the 24 Solar Terms.
*  the body structure. From head to foot, we introduce the problems that children need to pay attention to, e.g., caring for eyes, paying attention to hygiene when sneezing, and protecting teeth.
*  the qualities to ensure children's healthy and happy growth, e.g., friendship, creativity, and emotional management.

The selection of the picture book is based on:
* whether the picture books themselves are attractive, e.g., whether the words are beautiful and the pictures are vivid.
* whether the publisher is authoritative. Books from well-known publishers at home and abroad are generally authoritative, e.g., *Walker*, *Random*, and *Scholastic*.
* whether the picture books win awards, e.g., *the award of Hans Christian Andersen Award*, *Caldecott Medal*, and *Kate Greenaway Medal*.  

By presenting topics that are relevant, informational, and useful to our target groups, we can captivate people and gather maximum views. Through the above books-selection criteria, we can ensure the qualities of the recommended books to the greatest extent, which optimizes our brand image at the same time.

For short videos, **the most important thing** is the **title** and the **first three seconds** of the video, which determines whether it can capture the attention of users. When devising titles, we tend to use exaggerated or interrogative forms to arouse curiosity, e.g., *do you know what the fifth greatest Invention in China is?* At the first three seconds, we tend to list the real problems of children to win the resonance of parents and focus on their concerns to promote continual watching, e.g., *children love to eat sweets but do not like to brush their teeth. Is there a scientific solution?*

In the whole process of scriptwriting, we adhere to the principle of reasoning but not preaching. Combining the actor’s description with the books’ exhibition, the distinguishing feature of the picture book can be shown to the greatest extent. We show the most classic parts to the users, so that they can have a preliminary cognition of the picture book and judge whether they like and need it. In addition, we will control the length of the script, as short videos are designed to convey the key information in limited time. People may lose patience if the video is too long. Therefore, we keep the length of the videos around one minute and do our best to make the content clear, straightforward, and best illustrated, helping users both save time and money.

At the end of the script, we prefer to convey our thoughts on child development and parenting. The first is to encourage the children to grow up healthily and happily, be brave and confident, and enrich themselves as much as possible. The second is to let the parents invest more love and patience to their children, create a better learning and growth environment for their children, treat their children as friends, and grow together with their children.

### Techniques for Video Shooting

The background of our video is the office with bookshelves, which can show the editor's identity and professionalism, and let users trust the picture books we recommend. We also shoot picture books in the lounge with a relaxing and casual atmosphere, because most people browse short videos for relaxation.

The equipment for shooting includes tripod, light supplement lamp, voice-receptor, stabilizer and SLR camera to ensure the stable pictures, high-definition pixels, and clear sound of our videos. In addition, we tune the depth of field by adjusting the camera parameters to make videos look more advanced and textured.

We design and imagine a character, who can attract people's attention and introduce the educated-related topics naturally, as the speaker of our videos. The speaker we design is a magazine editor who has read a lot of picture books and is friendly to children. Later we choose the person closet to this figure in our office. She is beautiful and professional with sweet voice.

### Metrics for Video Editing
* **Coherency**. Videos are composed of different segments, e.g., teller introductions and picture book presentations. The most basic metric is to ensure the continuity of each part. We used professional editing software, e.g., *Adobe Premiere*, to edit each frame at the juncture of each part. We also use transition techniques, e.g., fade in, shallow out, and leave blank, to switch to different section. 
* **Consistency**. Music, subtitles, cover, light, and other elements are crucial. We select various music according to different themes of the videos, e.g., cheerful, relaxed and lyrical music. We choose different filters, brightness, subtitle size according to the conditions of picture books. We do fine tuning to keep the overall style consistent.
* **Uniqueness**.  Like a distinctive soundtrack with the representative beginning or end, we choose a special gesture and a representative sentence as our sign, and adopt a fixed cover page. This will give users a mindset that every time they see something like this, they'll think of our video.

### Observe People's Reaction and Give Analysis
Analyze the number of views, likes, and shares of each video. For videos with abundant views and likes, we summarize their successful reasons, e.g., appropriate topic selection, attractive introduction, and high-quality books. For videos with few views and likes, we carefully analyze the second at which viewers turn off the video. If they exit at the beginning, it means they are not interested in the topic of the video. If they quit at the introduction part, it means the introduction has not attracted the users. If they watch the whole video but not give a like to it, it means that the end of the video doesn't touch the viewer and the values we want to convey don't resonate with them. Based on such analysis, we learn lessons from published videos and make better ones.

### Video Promotion Strategies

Considering our target groups are young parents with the preference to browse videos at fast pace, we chose Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, as the main issuing platform. Since WeChat is extremely popular in China, we also put our videos on WeSee, the official video platform of WeChat, to increase exposure as much as possible.

Reward mechanisms are adopted to attract users. For example, users can participate in the lottery if they share the video, and they can receive picture books as gifts if they actively participate in the interaction. At the same time, we livestream to communicate about young parents' daily concerns, which makes our user portraits more accurate and sets up good reputation for our brand.
