## About Me

<img src='./assets/images/photo.jpg' width='240px' style="float:right">

I am Xuan Qian from Renmin University of China, a second-year Master student majoring in Philosophy, Politics, and Economy. I received my B.A. degree in School of Foreign Studies, China University of Mining and Technology in 2020.

I am eager to learn knowledge and do research about Communication Study. My research interests include interpersonal communication, epecially the communication behaviors in computer-mediated communication (CMC). I am motivated to explore:
* the processes through which people conduct and respond to various forms of information, and the variations of these processes for people of different cultures, social contexts, etc.
* the improper communication behaviors in CMC and their causes, e.g., information barriers.
* the relations of people's interaction behaviors and big data, the extent to which people fall into the communication traps, and the reasons why people fail to escape from the manipulation.
* the alienation of female communication behaviors in the era of big data characterized by the symbolization of female body and the erosion of female subjectivity.
